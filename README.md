## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies:

To begin, open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install the required dependencies (node_modules):

#### npm i

### Development Mode:

To run the development server, use the following command:

#### npm run dev

This command likely starts a development server, allowing you to work on and test your project. During development, you may benefit from features like detailed error messages and hot module replacement.

### Production Mode:

Build the Project:
#### npm run build
This command likely triggers a build process that prepares your project for production. It may involve tasks like bundling, minification, and optimization.

### Start the Production Server:

#### npm run start
After building the project, use this command to start the server in production mode. The production server is configured for performance, reliability, and security. Detailed error messages and debugging tools may be minimized or disabled.

### View the Result:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the result. This is the URL where your application should be accessible in both development and production modes.
